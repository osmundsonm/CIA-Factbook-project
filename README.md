# CIA-Factbook-project
An analysis of four variables contained within the CIA Facebook: population, population_growth, birth_rate, death_rate. I loaded the facts_df.csv file into Tableau to generate plots; there was a slight positive correlation between area (the size of the country) and population: the greater the area, the larger the population, which is logical. There was a positive correlation between birth rate and death rate.
